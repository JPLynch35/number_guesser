# Number Guesser

Number Guesser is a game where the user must guess the correct random number that the computer selects. For each guess, the page will let the user know if they were too high or too low.  Once they guess the correct answer, the page will show 'BOOM!'.
The range from which the number is randomly selected, is shown at the top of the page.  This defaults to 0 and 100, but the user is free to change this to whatever integers they want (including negative numbers).
The user can click on 'Reset' at any time to reset the random number and start from the beginnning of a game.  Each time the user wins, the range minimum will be decreased by 10, and the range maximum will be increased by 10.  Simply click on 'Reset' to start the next game.
